# gyroscope-program
Every one knows that when you use EV3 to build a car and use the block that was below to control the motor to run that’s inaccuracy if you puss the car just a little bit the car will still go astray but if you use the gyroscope program that I wright then the problem is solved
I use the my block builder
# The program
1.	The first one is to control to go forward and you need to type in how much do you want the car to move
2.	Second one to turn right ang left if you want to turn left there are three block the first one represent the motor’s power that was at the right and you can decide to turn left by two wheels are one wheel 
3.	The third is to use the ultrasonic sensor to run the motor if you want to let the car stop by seeing a thing than you should use this
